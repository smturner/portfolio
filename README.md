## Web-Page
If you click on the navigation links at the top of the webpage (about me, work, resume, contact me) they will take you to that section on the portfolio page. 

If you click on the boxes in the work section, each will take you to a deployed webpage of the project listed.

If you click on  "click here for resume link" it will take you to a new webpage with my current resume on it.

If you go to the contact me section it has my phone number and email and links to my linkedin website and github webpage.
